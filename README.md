# Linear-Logistic-Regression

# Deep Learning HW1: ML Basics: Regression and Classification
INSTRUCTIONS

1. In this homework, datasets from Student Performance Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository
(https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance) are utilized to build various regression/classiﬁcation models.
Those two datasets were combined and shuﬄed into a single dataset. The last column, cat, represents the classes the students belong to.

2. Please use train.csv to train/test your models and report regression/classiﬁcation results generated from the hidden test set,
test no G3.csv. The following columns should be included as predictors:
school, sex, age, famsize, studytime, failures, activities, higher, internet, romantic, famrel, freetime, goout, Dalc, Walc, health,
absences, and you need to transform binary columns to one-hot encoding vectors. The target is G3.

3. It is mandatory to build ALL functions with Python. Only Numpy/Pandas (for data preprocessing), seaborn (for plotting confusion matrix),
and matplotlib (for plotting regression results) are allowed in this homework.
NO machine learning platforms/packages are allowed such as TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Keras, etc.
